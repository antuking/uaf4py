ConcreteProducts Module

This module contains platform-specific and browser-specific concrete implementations of the driver classes. 
The `concrete_products` module is part of the Factory Design Pattern, where the abstract products defined in 
the `abstract_products` module are implemented with real-world logic for creating drivers for various mobile 
and web platforms.

This module is part of the `factories.driver.concrete_factory.concrete_products` hierarchy and serves to instantiate 
drivers for specific platforms, including mobile platforms like Android and iOS, as well as web browsers like Chrome, 
Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and Brave.

## Structure

The `concrete_products` module is divided into two subdirectories:

1. **mobile/**:
    - Contains concrete implementations for mobile drivers.
    - `concrete_android_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create an Android driver instance.
    - `concrete_ios_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create an iOS driver instance.
    - `concrete_mobile_driver.py`: General mobile driver implementation that combines Android and iOS logic.

2. **web/**:
    - Contains concrete implementations for web drivers across different browsers.
    - `concrete_chrome_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create a Chrome web driver instance.
    - `concrete_firefox_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create a Firefox web driver instance.
    - `concrete_msedge_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create a Microsoft Edge web driver instance.
    - `concrete_ie_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create an Internet Explorer web driver instance.
    - `concrete_brave_driver.py`: Implements the logic to create a Brave browser driver instance.
    - `concrete_web_driver.py`: General web driver implementation for browser-agnostic driver creation.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `concrete_products` module is to provide platform-specific implementations for the driver classes. 
These concrete classes implement the driver creation logic for specific mobile platforms and web browsers, making it 
possible to generate fully configured driver instances based on the required platform or browser.

This module enables the separation of driver logic for each platform, allowing for scalable and maintainable code. 
It ensures that new platforms or browsers can be easily added by implementing new concrete classes that extend 
the abstract base classes.

## Usage

The `concrete_products` module works in conjunction with the `concrete_factory` module to instantiate drivers. 
Clients interact with the concrete factory classes, which then use the platform-specific logic from `concrete_products` 
to create the appropriate driver instance.

Example for creating a concrete mobile driver:

```python
from factories.driver.concrete_factory.concrete_products.mobile.concrete_android_driver import ConcreteAndroidDriver

android_driver = ConcreteAndroidDriver(remote_url="http://localhost:4723/wd/hub")
driver = android_driver.get_driver(capabilities={"platformName": "Android", "deviceName": "Pixel_4"})

from factories.driver.concrete_factory.concrete_web_driver_factory import ConcreteWebDriverFactory

web_driver_factory = ConcreteWebDriverFactory()
driver = web_driver_factory.get_web_driver(
    browser_make=WebBrowserMake.CHROME,
    options={"headless": True}
)
